### Data Intensive Ecology

**Course Overview**

Data Intensive Ecology is a semester-long course that aims to provide undergraduate students the opportunity to conduct directed research on a subject of their choice, developing skills in data analysis, ecological research, and science communication. 

**Project Reflection**

While in this course, I learned how to access various ecological databases and use R to wrangle and analyze data. I was also able to practice the critical skills of individual and collaborative problem-solving, as well as present research by participating in Agnes Scott’s Spring Annual Research Conference(SpARC). Through the completion of this course and research project, I believe I gained a greater understanding of the scientific process and its nonlinear nature. This project went through many phases of various research questions, data sets, and methods of analysis; while these changes were inconvenient, I quickly learned each phase was an opportunity for redirection to the final research question, best-fit set, and most accurate data analysis. 

**Abstract**

Salamanders, along with other amphibians, are known for being highly sensitive to their environments, often being an indicator of harmful ecological disturbances. Salamanders are dependent on vernal pools, temporary bodies of water created from seasonal rainfall and snow melt, which provide a place for the eggs to develop into adults without the disturbance of predators such as fish. This project aims to look at the impact of climate change on salamander populations in hopes of drawing broader predictions on the ecological impact of climate change. It is suspected that due to changes in environmental conditions(i.e., fluctuations in temperature and precipitation) over time, certain species will thrive more than others, leading to higher occurrences of these more successful species. Extensive population data published in the Environment Data Initiative (EDI) data portal from New York’s Mohonk Nature Preserve, including a 90 year record of yearly recordings of live species and egg mass observations for five salamander species in 11 vernal pools was used with temperature and precipitation recordings from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Using the R coding language, salamander species and egg mass observations were paired with the average annual maximum and minimum temperature and total precipitation(including rain, snow, and hail) of the area to determine if there are any patterns between the quantity of live salamander or egg mass observations and climate. 

**Methods**

Salamander and weather data was cleaned to join metrics by year.

In order to visualize the relationship between live salamander occurences and egg mass counts with weather metrics I chose to create dual y axis graphs.

- Strong relationship between salamander egg mass counts and every weather metric
- Strong relationship between live salamander occurrence and precipitation and annual average maximum temperature
- No relationship between species and any weather metric
